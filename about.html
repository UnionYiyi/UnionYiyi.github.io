  <h1>About UnionYiyi</h1>
  <p>
    UnionYiyi was born from a single belief: that true rest is sacred. We create timeless bedding in cotton, linen, and silk — natural fabrics with ancient roots — to help restore your connection to self, nature, and rhythm.
  </p>
  <p>
    Based in Weifang, Shandong, our collections are developed with trusted artisans and small-scale factories who share our respect for material honesty, design clarity, and responsible production. We are not a warehouse of trends — we are a studio of meaning.
  </p>
  <p>
    We don’t believe in fast. We believe in enduring. Welcome to UnionYiyi.
